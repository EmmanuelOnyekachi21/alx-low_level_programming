## About

In this project, we explore the concept of structures and typedef in the C programming language. We implement various functions and programs that demonstrate the usage of structures and typedef to create more organized and flexible code.

## Compilation

To compile the C source code files, you can use the following commands:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o output_filename

Replace output_filename with your desired name for the compiled executable.
Files

Here is a list of the task subdirectories along with a brief description of each:

    0-poppy/: Define a struct named dog with specific elements.
    1-init_dog/: Initialize a variable of type struct dog.
    2-print_dog/: Print the contents of a struct dog.
    3-dog_type/: Define a new type dog_t as an alias for struct dog.
    4-new_dog/: Create a new dog_t structure.
    5-free_dog/: Free memory allocated for a dog_t structure.

Usage

Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a specific task. Inside each subdirectory, you'll find the source code files and possibly additional resources or documentation related to that task. To test or use the code, follow the compilation and execution instructions provided in each task's respective directory.
