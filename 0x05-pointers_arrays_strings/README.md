## Introduction

In this directory, you'll find C programs that cover the following topics:

- Pointers: How to declare, initialize, and use pointers to access memory addresses and manipulate data indirectly.
- Arrays: How to declare, initialize, and use arrays to store collections of elements of the same type.
- Strings: How to work with strings in C, including string manipulation and various string functions.

These programs are aimed at improving your understanding of these essential concepts in C programming and help you become more proficient in writing C code.

## Files

Here is a list of files included in this directory:

1. `0-reset_to_98.c`: A C function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
2. `1-swap.c`: A C function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.
3. `2-strlen.c`: A C function that returns the length of a string using pointers.
4. `3-puts.c`: A C function that prints a string to the standard output using pointers.
5. `4-print_rev.c`: A C function that prints the reverse of a string using pointers.
6. `5-rev_string.c`: A C function that reverses a string in place using pointers.
7. `6-puts2.c`: A C function that prints every other character of a string, starting from the first character, using pointers.
8. `7-puts_half.c`: A C function that prints the second half of a string using pointers.
9. `8-print_array.c`: A C function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers using pointers.
10. `9-strcpy.c`: A C function that copies a string to another using pointers.

Feel free to explore and review the source code of each file to understand the implementations better.

## Setup

To compile and run these C programs, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is commonly available on most Unix-like operating systems.

If you don't have GCC installed, you can download and install it from the official GCC website or use a package manager specific to your operating system.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to compile and run the C programs:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired C file.
3. Use the following command to compile the C file (replace `filename.c` with the actual filename):

```gcc -o output_filename filename.c```


This will generate an executable file named `output_filename` in the same directory.

4. Run the compiled program using the following command:

```./output_filename```
Now, you should see the output of the C program printed on the screen.
