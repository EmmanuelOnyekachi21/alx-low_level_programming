# alx-low_level_programming

This repository contains code and resources for the alx-low_level_programming project, focusing on learning and practicing low-level programming concepts using the C language.

## Resources

Before starting the project, it is recommended to go through the following resources:

- "Everything you need to know to start with C.pdf" (Read entirely)
- Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan's contributions to the C language
- Understanding the C program compilation process
- The Betty coding style guide for writing clean and readable code
- The role of the main function and its influence on the program's return value

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the significance of low-level programming and the C language
- Identify the inventors of C: Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds
- Explain the compilation process when using gcc to compile C code
- Comprehend the entry point and the role of the main function in a C program
- Print text using printf, puts, and putchar functions
- Determine the size of a specific type using the sizeof operator
- Compile C code using gcc with the necessary flags
- Follow the official C coding style, validated using the betty-style checker
- Include the appropriate headers for standard library functions
- Understand how the return value of the main function influences the program

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Include a README.md file at the root of the repository, providing an overview of the project
- No compilation errors or warnings should be present
- Do not use the system function
- Code should adhere to the Betty coding style, validated using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Betty Linter

To run the Betty linter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Betty repository: [https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)
2. Install the linter using sudo ./install.sh
3. Move the Betty script to a directory in your $PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin/)

You can now run the Betty linter by executing betty <filename>.

Remember, understanding the concepts and writing your own code is crucial for learning. Avoid copying and pasting solutions. Good luck with your journey into low-level programming!
