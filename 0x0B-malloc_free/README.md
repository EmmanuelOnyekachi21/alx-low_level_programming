# 0x0B-malloc_free Task

This repository contains solutions and explanations for tasks related to dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and memory deallocation using `free`.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates my understanding of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C using the `malloc` and `free` functions.

## Tasks

The tasks are organized into directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of memory management:

### Task 0: Create a Dynamic Array

This task demonstrates how to allocate memory for an array of integers using `malloc` and release that memory using `free`.

### Task 1: Create a Dynamic String

This task showcases how to allocate memory for a string (array of characters) using `malloc`, read user input, and release the allocated memory using `free`.

### Task 2: Extend the Array

Here, the dynamic array from Task 0 is extended using the `realloc` function, highlighting memory block resizing.

### Task 3: Create a 2D Array

This task illustrates how to allocate memory for a dynamic 2D array (matrix-like structure) using `malloc`.

### Task 4: Free a 2D Array

Building on Task 3, this task demonstrates proper memory deallocation for the dynamic 2D array using nested loops.

### Task 5: Create an Array of Strings

In this task, memory allocation for an array of strings (array of pointers to char) using `malloc` and `free` is explained.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to a specific task directory.
3. Review source code and comments to understand concepts and solutions.
4. Compile and run code to observe results.

## Usage

This project aids in learning and practicing dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C. Tasks offer examples and explanations for improved comprehension.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of memory management.
