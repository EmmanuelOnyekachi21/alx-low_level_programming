## Description

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In this project, we explore various tasks that utilize recursion to solve problems such as printing a string in reverse, calculating factorials, finding the square root, and checking for prime numbers.

## Tasks

1. **0-puts_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
2. **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: A function that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.
3. **2-strlen_recursion.c**: A function that returns the length of a string, using recursion.
4. **3-factorial.c**: A function that returns the factorial of a given number, using recursion.
5. **4-pow_recursion.c**: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, using recursion.
6. **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: A function that returns the natural square root of a number, using recursion.
7. **6-is_prime_number.c**: A function that checks if a number is a prime number, using recursion.

## How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine and compile the C files using a C compiler (gcc, for example).

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o output_file input_file.c

Replace output_file with the desired executable name and input_file.c with the filename of the C file you want to compile.

Run the compiled executable.

$ ./output_file
