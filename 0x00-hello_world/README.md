# 0x00-hello_world

This directory contains the code and resources for the 0x00-hello_world project. The project focuses on getting started with C programming by implementing basic "Hello, World!" programs and understanding the compilation process.

## Files

- [0-preprocessor](./0-preprocessor): A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
- [1-compiler](./1-compiler): A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- [2-assembler](./2-assembler): A script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it into a file.
- [3-name](./3-name): A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c): A C program that prints a specific string using the `puts` function.
- [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c): A C program that prints a specific string using the `printf` function.
- [6-size.c](./6-size.c): A C program that prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## Compilation

To compile the C programs in this directory, use the following format:
gcc [file-name.c] -o [output-file]


Replace `[file-name.c]` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `[output-file]` with the desired name for the output executable.

## Usage

After compiling the C programs, run the executables using the following format:
./[executable-name]


Replace `[executable-name]` with the name of the compiled executable file.
