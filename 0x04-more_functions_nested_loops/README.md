# 0x04 C - More functions, more nested loops

This repository contains my solutions to ALX's "C - More functions, more nested loops" tasks. The tasks are designed to enhance my understanding and practice of functions and nested loops in the C programming language.

## Description

In this project, I've completed a series of C programs to solve various tasks related to functions and nested loops. Each task focuses on a different aspect of the C language and helps to reinforce the concepts learned throughout the ALX program.

## List of Functions

Below is the list of C functions implemented as part of this project:

1. **isupper**: Checks if a character is uppercase.
2. **isdigit**: Checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9).
3. **mul**: Multiplies two integers.
4. **print_numbers**: Prints numbers from 0 to 9.
5. **print_most_numbers**: Prints numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
6. **more_numbers**: Prints numbers from 0 to 14, ten times.
7. **print_line**: Draws a straight line using the character '_'.
8. **print_diagonal**: Draws a diagonal line using the character '\'.
9. **print_square**: Prints a square using the character '#'.
10. **fizz_buzz**: Prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz."
11. **print_triangle**: Prints a triangle using the character '#'.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed on your system:

1. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): To compile the C programs.
2. Make: To use the Makefile for easier compilation.
3. Any text editor of your choice (e.g., Vim, Nano, VSCode, etc.).
