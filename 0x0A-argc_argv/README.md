# 0x0A-argc_argv

This repository contains C programs that showcase the usage of command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`).

## Tasks

### Task 0 - Print Program Name

Prints the name of the program.

### Task 1 - Print All Arguments

Prints all the arguments passed to the program.

### Task 2 - Print Number of Arguments

Prints the number of arguments passed to the program.

### Task 3 - Print Arguments in Reverse

Prints all the arguments in reverse order.

### Task 4 - Sum of Arguments

Prints the sum of positive numbers passed as arguments.

### Task 5 - Multiply Arguments

Prints the product of positive numbers passed as arguments.

## Getting Started

These examples provide insights into working with command-line arguments in C, from basic to advanced scenarios. Each example is designed to help you understand different aspects of `argc` and `argv` usage.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a C compiler to compile and run these programs. Commonly used compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0A-argc_argv.git
   cd 0x0A-argc_argv

    Compile the example programs using your preferred compiler. For example:

    sh

gcc task_0.c -o task_0

Run the compiled programs with command-line arguments:

sh

    ./task_0 arg1 arg2
