# 0x02-functions_nested_loops

This directory contains C programs related to functions and nested loops. It includes various examples and exercises to practice working with functions and nested loop structures.

## Files

- `0-putchar.c`: A program that prints `_putchar` followed by a new line.
- `1-alphabet.c`: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: A function that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times.
- `3-islower.c`: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
- `4-isalpha.c`: A function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
- `5-sign.c`: A function that prints the sign of a number.
- `6-abs.c`: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- `7-print_last_digit.c`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
- `8-24_hours.c`: A function that prints every minute of a day in the format "HH:MM".
- `9-times_table.c`: A function that prints the 9 times table.
- `10-add.c`: A function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `11-print_to_98.c`: A function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.

## Usage

To compile and run the programs, you need a C compiler such as `gcc`. Use the following command to compile a program:

```gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <file_name.c> -o <output_file>


Replace `<file_name.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

After compilation, run the program using the following command:
``` ./<output_file>


Replace `<output_file>` with the name of the compiled executable file.
