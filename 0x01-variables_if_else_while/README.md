# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This repository contains solutions for the tasks related to the `0x01-variables_if_else_while` project.

## Description

In this project, we explore the basics of variables, conditional statements (if-else), and loops (while) in the C programming language. Each task focuses on different aspects of these concepts, helping us understand how to use variables, control program flow with conditional statements, and iterate using loops.

## Files

The following files are included in this project:

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: A program that generates a random number and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: A program that prints the last digit of a random number and checks if it is greater than 5, zero, or less than 6 and not zero.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase using loops.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 using a loop.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: A program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 without using `char` variables or `printf` format specifier `%d`.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating between lowercase and uppercase letters.
- `8-print_base16.c`: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- `9-print_comb.c`: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

## Getting Started

To run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x01-variables_if_else_while.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd 0x01-variables_if_else_while

3. Compile the desired program using a C compiler, for example, gcc:

   ```bash
   $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <file-name.c> -o <output-file>

4. Execute the compiled progam:

   ```bash
   $ ./<output-file>
